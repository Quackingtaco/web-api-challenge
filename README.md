# Web-API-Challenge

## Description
This challenge is to create a dynamic code quiz that starts a timer when the quiz is begun. As the user moves through the quiz incorrect answers deduct time. When the quiz is complete or timer hits 0, the quiz ends and the user is able to record their initials and time and view a list of saved scores.
